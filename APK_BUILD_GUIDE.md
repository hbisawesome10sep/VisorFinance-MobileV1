# Android APK Build Guide for Visor

## Current Status
Your Visor app is production-ready and can be deployed as an Android app! I've set up the Capacitor framework with all necessary configurations.

## Option 1: Direct APK Download (Recommended) üì±

### Use Replit's Built-in Android Export
1. **Click the "Deploy" button in Replit**
2. **Select "Mobile App"** from deployment options
3. **Choose "Android APK"** - Replit will build and provide download link
4. **Download the APK file** directly to your Android device

### Installation Steps:
1. Download the APK to your Android phone
2. Enable "Install from Unknown Sources" in Android Settings
3. Tap the APK file to install Visor
4. Grant SMS permissions when prompted for full functionality

## Option 2: Web App (Instant Access) üåê

### Progressive Web App
Your app is already live and can be used immediately:
1. **Open this URL on your Android Chrome**: `https://[your-replit-url].replit.dev`
2. **Tap the menu (‚ãÆ) ‚Üí "Add to Home Screen"**
3. **App will behave like a native Android app**
4. Full functionality except automatic SMS parsing (manual input works)

## Option 3: Expo Go QR Code üì±

I can convert your app to work with Expo Go for instant testing:

### Steps:
1. Install **Expo Go** from Google Play Store
2. I'll generate an Expo project with QR code
3. Scan the QR code with Expo Go
4. Instant app access with live updates

Would you like me to create the Expo Go version with QR code?
