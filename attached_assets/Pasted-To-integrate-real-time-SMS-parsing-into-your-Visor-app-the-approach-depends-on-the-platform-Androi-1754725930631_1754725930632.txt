To integrate real-time SMS parsing into your Visor app, the approach depends on the platform (Android, iOS, Web).
Since SMS access is restricted differently per OS, you’ll need to handle this carefully:
1. Android – Direct SMS Access
Android allows SMS parsing via native permissions, but Google Play now restricts READ_SMS permissions unless your app’s core function requires it.
For financial apps like Visor, you can apply for this permission under “Default SMS handler or Financial Services” use case.
Steps for Android Native SMS Parsing
Request Permission
Add READ_SMS and RECEIVE_SMS permissions in AndroidManifest.xml.
Dynamically request runtime permissions in the app.
Use an SMS Retriever API (Google Recommended)
Pros: Doesn’t require READ_SMS permission.
Cons: Works only for messages with a unique app hash at the end (OTP-style).
Not great for parsing generic bank messages.
Custom BroadcastReceiver
Implement a BroadcastReceiver for android.provider.Telephony.SMS_RECEIVED.
Parse the message body for transaction patterns:
₹2,500 debited from your A/C ****1234 on 08-08-2025 at 10:45AM
Extract amount, type (credit/debit), merchant, and account number.
Push this parsed transaction into your app’s local store and update dashboard + AI insights instantly.
Offline-first Processing
Save parsed transactions in local database (SQLite/Room).
Sync with backend when online.
2. iOS – No Direct SMS Reading
Apple does not allow apps to read SMS directly due to privacy policies.
Alternatives:
Email Parsing
Ask user to link their email (Gmail, Outlook API).
Parse transaction alerts from their bank emails.
Works well for credit card + bank alerts.
Bank Account Linking (PAN + Account Aggregator Framework)
India’s Account Aggregator system (e.g., via Perfios, Finvu, OneMoney) can fetch transaction data directly from banks with user consent.
100% RBI-compliant.
User Upload Option
Let user copy-paste SMS into the app or upload .txt export from iCloud Messages (not very elegant, but safe).
3. Cross-Platform Best Approach for Visor
Since Visor targets Android, iOS, Web, we can make SMS parsing Android-only, while using email parsing + bank linking for iOS and Web.
Hybrid Flow
Android users:
Real-time parsing via BroadcastReceiver → update transactions instantly.
iOS users:
Email API + Account Aggregator → pull transaction history in near real time.
4. Parsing Logic
Maintain a Regex library for parsing bank SMS formats:
/(?:credited|debited|withdrawn|spent|purchased|paid).*?(₹[\d,]+)/i
Map sender IDs to banks (HDFCBK, ICICIB, etc.).
Detect:
Amount
Transaction type (credit/debit)
Merchant/description
Date & time
Categorize automatically (Food, Bills, Salary, etc.).
Push to Transactions store and trigger AI Insights update.
5. Real-Time Update in the App
Use a global store (Zustand, Redux, Context API) to instantly push parsed transactions into the UI.
Trigger:
Dashboard refresh
AI insights recalculation
Notifications:
"New Transaction Detected: ₹2,500 spent on Groceries."
