Absolutely! Here's your **meticulously detailed Replit prompt** for building the **Transactions Tab** of **Visor**, based on everything we've built, fixed, discussed, and imagined so far:

## 📥 Replit Prompt: Build the "Transactions" Tab for **Visor**

You're building the **Transactions** tab of **Visor**, an AI-powered personal finance app. This tab is the central ledger where users can **view, add, edit, delete, split, and mark recurring transactions** — across **Income**, **Expenses**, and **Investments** — all in real-time with an intuitive and beautifully minimal UI.

---

### 🌟 Design Philosophy

* Use a **clean, modern iOS 16–17 inspired look**: rounded-2xl cards, smooth shadows, soft pastel accents.
* **Icons** from Heroicons / Lucide / Tabler — **no emojis**
* Fully **mobile responsive**, but scales gracefully on tablet and web (more space = richer view)
* All elements should feel **tactile, smooth, adaptive**
* Use `Inter` or `font-sans` typography, proper padding (`p-4`, `mb-4`, `gap-4`)
* Light and Dark themes ready

---

### 📌 Layout & Features

#### 🔍 1. Top Bar

* Title: `Transactions`
* Optional dropdown: **Filter by Month**
* Search bar: filter by keyword (title, category)
* Filter buttons:

  * Income / Expense / Investment / All
  * Category filter dropdown
  * Date range picker

---

#### 📋 2. Transaction List

* Scrollable vertical list of user’s transactions (most recent on top)
* Each transaction card includes:

  * Icon based on category (e.g., `Banknote` for salary, `Pizza` for food)
  * Title (e.g., “Grocery shopping”)
  * Category (subtext)
  * Amount (with + / – and color-coded: green = income, red = expense)
  * Date
* Tap a card to **Edit / Delete / Duplicate**

---

#### ➕ 3. FAB (Floating Action Button)

* Bottom-right corner FAB (blue “+” icon) expands into:

  * `Add Income`
  * `Add Expense`
  * `Add Investment`
* Animate expansion with scale and fade

---

### 🧾 4. Add / Edit Transaction Modal

Reusable modal with:

#### 📝 Input Fields:

* Type: Toggle or dropdown (Income / Expense / Investment)
* Title: Text input (e.g., “Monthly Salary”)
* Amount: Input with ₹ prefix and validations
* Category: Horizontal scroll with icons (not emojis), based on type
* Date: Date Picker
* Notes: Optional text area

#### 🔁 Toggles:

* **Recurring**

  * If toggled, show dropdown: weekly / monthly / quarterly
  * Notify user if amount is not in range (₹2 to ₹10,00,000)
* **Split Transaction**

  * If toggled, input participant names (tags or comma-separated)
  * Notify if split amount is outside the ₹2 to ₹10,00,000 range

#### ✅ Buttons:

* `Save` / `Cancel`
* Validate form before allowing save
* Auto-close on save, update in real time

---

### 🔧 5. Edit/Delete Transaction

* Long press or tap → show:

  * Edit (open same modal pre-filled)
  * Delete (confirm before remove)
  * Duplicate (copy transaction and reopen modal for quick edits)

---

### 🧠 6. Data Handling & Updates

* All transactions should:

  * Immediately update the dashboard summaries
  * Recalculate AI Insights
  * Persist to localStorage (or mock backend if present)
* Create a `TransactionContext` (or Zustand store) with:

  ```ts
  {
    transactions: Transaction[],
    addTransaction: (tx) => void,
    updateTransaction: (id, updated) => void,
    deleteTransaction: (id) => void,
    filterTransactions: (criteria) => Transaction[]
  }
  ```

---

### 🗃️ 7. Data Model Example

```ts
interface Transaction {
  id: string;
  type: 'income' | 'expense' | 'investment';
  title: string;
  amount: number;
  category: string;
  date: string; // ISO string
  notes?: string;
  isRecurring: boolean;
  recurrence?: 'weekly' | 'monthly' | 'quarterly';
  isSplit: boolean;
  splitWith?: string[];
}
```
